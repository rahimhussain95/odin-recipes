# odin-recipes
Project: Recipes
1. The current project is a test of making an html page with recipes for the odin project assignment.
2. So far I have learned proficiency in C, Python, data structures, pointers, dictionaries, lists, recursion, git/github, scratch lol, HTML, very little CSS and javascript, SQL.
3. Hope to be able to make a fully fledged website with pages, organized, presentable, and runs smoothly while neatly conveying the message and pictures I desire.
